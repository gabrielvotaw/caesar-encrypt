## About the Project

A Caesar cipher is a shift cipher that encrypts a message by shifting letters of the message a set number of letters over.<br />
<br />
Thus, there are only 25 possible keys. (A maps to B, C, ... , Z)<br />
<br />
This program was created to encrypt any plaintext into a Caesar cipher.<br />
<br />
The project contains both a Java and C++ version.<br />
<br />
